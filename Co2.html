            Nevertheless, the UAE has compiled this initial set of attractive
            strategies in an effort to demonstrate its solidarity with the
            international community in tackling the threat of climate change, as
            well as to inform future policy discussions. Such initiatives
            includes new appliance standards, high efficiency district cooling
            systems, rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, more efficient electric
            motors, solar powered desalinization plants, fuel economy standards
            for light duty vehicle imports, and landfill gas capture and use for
            power production are some of the measures that upon review show
            promise for reducing GHG emissions while promoting economic
            development.

            The Royal College of Physicians estimates that in the UK alone,
            40,000 deaths a year are attributable to outdoor air pollution. Last
            year, an emissions surcharge, known as the "T-charge", was
            introduced to tackle pollution in London, which frequently misses
            air quality targets. It charges drivers of diesel and petrol
            vehicles registered before 2006 Dh52 a day to drive in central
            London during weekday daytime in an attempt to tackle air pollution.
            According to the RAC, this will include cars, vans, minibuses,
            buses, coaches and HGVs, motorbikes, motorised caravans and
            horseboxes, private ambulances, motor hearses, dual purpose vehicles
            and other specialist vehicle types that do not meet the minimum Euro
            4 emission standard, a classification based on the age of the car.

            “Vehicle emission accounts for 75-80% of Dubai’s air pollution,
            while the rest is due to emissions from manufacturing industries and
            power plants,” said Abdullah Raffia, assistant director general of
            Dubai Municipality for Environment and Public Health Affairs.
            According to Raffia, the survey aims to measure pollutant levels in
            a car’s exhaust while the vehicle is travelling on the road. It will
            detect the five major air pollutants: hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide,
            nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and smoke emissions. The survey will
            use remote sensing technology that eliminates the need to physically
            connect the device to a car. The municipality is working with the
            Dubai Roads & Transport Authority (RTA) and Dubai Police to carry
            out the project. According to the current law, driving a vehicle
            with excessive emissions that pollute the environment carries a fine
            of AED300. During the period 1999 to 2006, some 1115 vehicles were
            reported.
