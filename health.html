        <h4>
          Children’s immune systems and organs are still developing, and they
          eat and drink more for their size. They also breathe at a faster rate,
          increasing their exposure to dangerous air pollutants that can damage
          their lungs.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Climate change makes heat waves hotter and longer—and potentially
          dangerous for kids to play outside. This is a critical issue because
          the number one health challenge facing our children today is obesity.
          When they do spend time outdoors, it can lead to heat stress and
          greater exposure to disease-carrying insects like ticks and
          mosquitoes.

            Air pollution accounts for 20% of newborn deaths worldwide, most
            related to complications of low birth weight and preterm birth.

            Thousands of children under the age of 5 die prematurely each year
            from lower respiratory infections caused by air pollution from
            burning fossil fuels.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carbon dioxide, which fuels climate change, also causes more pollen
            production in plants that trigger seasonal allergies. Warming has
            also led to earlier springs and longer growing seasons for many
            allergenic plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Air pollution affects neurodevelopment, leading to lower cognitive
            test outcomes, negatively affecting mental and motor development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Air pollution is damaging children’s lung function, even at lower
            levels of exposures
          </li>
          <li>
            Globally, 93% of the world’s children under 15 years of age are
            exposed to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels above WHO
            air quality guidelines, which include the 630 million of children
            under 5 years of age, and 1.8 billion of children under 15 years
          </li>
          <li>
            In low- and middle-income countries around the world, 98% of all
            children under 5 are exposed to PM2.5 levels above WHO air quality
            guidelines. In comparison, in high-income countries, 52% of children
            under 5 are exposed to levels above WHO air quality guidelines.
          </li>
          <li>
            More than 40% of the world’s population – which includes 1 billion
            children under 15 - is exposed to high levels of household air
            pollution from mainly cooking with polluting technologies and fuels.
          </li>
          <li>
            About 600’000 deaths in children under 15 years of age were
            attributed to the joint effects of ambient and household air
            pollution in 2016.
          </li>
          <li>
            Together, household air pollution from cooking and ambient (outside)
            air pollution cause more than 50% of acute lower respiratory
            infections in children under 5 years of age in low- and
            middle-income countries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Air pollution is one of the leading threats to child health,
            accounting for almost 1 in 10 deaths in children under five years of
            age.
